1. Provide the domain name associated with your load balancer so I can test web server access to it.
http://minions-balancer-1898797850.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/

2. Describe the results of testing your load balancer when you shut down one, then both, back-end instances, and when you restore them.
I tested shutting down one webserver on my personal instance, which has a different index.html than Mufassa and Dave 
(they have the default apache2 index, and mine is a simple html page with a grey background), and before I stopped apache, I would see the default
apache site come up some of the time, and every once in a while my grey page would be served instead. But when I shut down apache on my instance, 
only the default apache page would come up and the EC2 management console eventually indicated one of the webservers was down, although it took longer
than expected. Apache also came back up a bit faster than expected on my instance (I didn't specifically start the service again), but I guess that's a good thing.

3. Provide excerpts from web server logs from each of your web server instances showing load balancer health checks and accesses to your web content.
Here are a few of many:

4. Indicate the Puppet code you use to replicate content between your web server instances.
I included this section in the web-server module's init.pp file:

    # To manage the apache2 DocumentRoots of each of our instances so we have consistant web content across instances.
    file { '/var/www/html':
        source => "puppet:///modules/web-server/html",
        # Make sure this is a directory
        ensure  => directory,
        mode    => 644,
        owner   => ubuntu,
        group   => ubuntu,
        # Recurse through the folder to synchronize everything
        recurse => true,
        # Would probably be wise to ensure apache exists? Might not be necessary.
        require => Package["apache2"],
        # One source, to rule them all
        replace => true,
    }
