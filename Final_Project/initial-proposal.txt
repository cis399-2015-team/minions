- Concrete project goals:
  - Set up a SQL server on one of our instances
  - Manage SQL client installation with puppet on our other instances
  - Make a basic fake database for something
  - Maybe make it possible to interact with via a webpage

- Effect on user population
  - Making it have a friendlier interface (web interface) would make it easier for users to interact with the database without needing to know the syntax
  - If the database/SQL program has problems - we need to have contingency plans to get it back up/repaired as fast as possible (puppet management) having it distributed across systems is useful too
  
- Security Issues
  - Making sure users have appropriate access to appropriate tables, not able to insert/delete/modify inappropriate database information

- Work needed to complete project
  - Installing the SQL server to be run on one instance
  - Create a puppet module to manage the installation/contingency for other instances accessing the server instance
  - Set up the actual database with mock information and access privileges
  - Use PHP or something similar to hook it up to a webpage


Follow-up Questions:
- What SQL server are you planning to use?
  - MySQL

- What specific web interface front end or application might you use to demonstrate the database functionality?
  - Possibly create a fake company database with employee information/product tables to demonstrate 
    different levels of appropriate access. I'm familiar with using PHP to connect to MySQL database hosts,
    but I'm also open to suggestions (mostly because PHP is the devil).

- It's often possible to set up database replication to provice better data protection or even load-balancing
  for access. Is there a way to do that with your chosen database system? What kind of effort would that involve?
  - I think that was something we had in mind when thinking of this as a project, honestly I'm not that familiar 
    with how to do it *yet* but we can all do some research! If it would require using a different server though,
    it might be an additional hurdle.

- Can you provide automation or self-service for users to create and manage their databases?
  - That's a reasonable expectation, we will talk about it further and come up with a more concrete idea/use cases.
