== MySQL Server configuration management ==
There is a puppet module which is attached to the minions-puppetmaster node to manage the status/configuration
of the mysql server found there.

This package overwrites the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file with the file within the module called mysql-server_config, 
which was copied from the default initially. The file sets the mode to read/write by owner, and ensures the
package is installed before being finished with the file.

The service is enabled to automatically start at boot time, restart if it is not running, allows status info,
allows restarting, and also requries the mysql-server package and configuration file to be present, and and
any changes to the config file to cause the service to restart.



== A Note on the Database ==
For convenience, we are using the database Lily created for her Database Processing class last fall for the 
fake coffee company "Brewed Awakening" written in MySQL using InnoDB (a storage engine for MySQL).
