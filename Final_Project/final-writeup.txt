== Introduction ==
For the final project for the 2015 iteration of CiS 399, team Minions has set up a MySQL server with a full
web management interface. For the purposes of this class, circumstances and timeframe, the database is
reasonably secure. Users may manage their authorized tables, but it takes a system administrator with access 
to the proper EC2 instance to create or remove users.   


== A Note on the Database ==
For convenience, we are using the database Lily created for her Database Processing class last fall for the
fake coffee company "Brewed Awakening" written in MySQL using InnoDB (a storage engine for MySQL). 


== PHP on apache2 ==
I added a few extensions to the web-server module because it sense to extend that module rather than make a 
new one just for PHP + stuff, since it will be used in tandem for our purposes.
I have experience in PHP used with MySQL, and it has many useful libraries and extensions, which is why I 
decided to use it.


== MySQL Server configuration management ==
There is a puppet module which is attached to the minions-puppetmaster node to manage the status/configuration
of the mysql server found there.

This package overwrites the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file with the file within the module called mysql-server_config, 
which was copied from the default initially. The file sets the mode to read/write by owner, and ensures the
package is installed before being finished with the file.

The service is enabled to automatically start at boot time, restart if it is not running, allows status info,
allows restarting, and also requries the mysql-server package and configuration file to be present, and and
any changes to the config file to cause the service to restart.


== phpMyAdmin to manage tables and DBA users ==
After struggling in the console for quite some time, I decided to try to use phpMyAdmin for database management.
For the purpose of creating multiple phpMyAdmin accounts for pretend DBAs who would need to be able to manage
their own table set at will (and so their accounts could be removed if/when they left this company), the 
following php5 modules were used: php5-gd, php5-mysql php5-mcrypt.

In particular, mycrypt supports a variety of block algorithms: ES, TripleDES, Blowfish (default), 3-WAY, 
SAFER-SK64, SAFER-SK128, TWOFISH, TEA, RC2 and GOST in CBC, OFB, CFB and ECB cipher modes. Additionally, it 
supports RC6 and IDEA which are considered "non-free". CFB/OFB are 8bit by default. To be used to secure DBA 
user accounts.

To connect to the web management interface, I enabled the apache web-server module on the puppetmaster EC2 instance 
(since it hosts the mysql server and is the designated instance for admin tasks) so - you must go to the IP/DNS of
the minions-puppetmaster instance (currently http://52.27.162.176/phpmyadmin) and enter the administrator credentials
sent to you. From there, you may perform actions similar to using something like MySQL workbench, but hosted on the 
web! Users may only see/modify tables that they own.
